				"We are what we eat”. Indeed, food is everywhere in today’s world, and its impact on our system is huge. Of course we have come a long way since the beginning of humanity when access to food was essential for survival. But yet, the increasingly rapid development of our society brings with it new risks and opportunities, each time challenging our current system. Global warming, the increase in population, the emergence of new countries in globalization, among many others, will all somehow result in a profound change in our food production system.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, the study of our food system is a pretext to recall known events and phenomena as history has had and will have a significant impact on the way we eat. If we take the example of a war, we will find its impact clearly in the food of the time. However, even further on, we believe that research must also be able to reverse this direction of questioning, by showing how food teaches us something about the society that produces and consumes it. The study of food production is then no longer simply used as a proof, but rather as a research tool that truly allows us to learn more about our own society.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this project, we will try to apply our skills and give insights to tell a story which truly matters. We want to create good visualizations to give our audience a good understanding of the changes that are being brought to light in the models we are given to study, and more importantly, allow to put these changes into perspective with our current society in order to understand the changes and challenges that we will face in the future.

			What can we see ?

			<p>
				The Shared Socio-Economic Pathway (SSPs) are Climate change projections and socio‐economic scenarios used to evaluate climate impacts and adaptation measures.
				They are stablished by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation (Mitigation is a more development-friendly alternative to strict environmental laws because it allows development to occur where environmental laws might prohibit it.).
				<br>
				The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development.
				<br> <br>
				Overview : <br>

				SSP1: low challenges for mitigation (resource efficiency) and adaptation (rapid development)<br>
				SSP3: high challenges for mitigation (regionalized energy / land policies) and adaptation (slow development) <br>
				SSP4: low challenges for mitigation (global high tech economy), high for adapt. (regional low tech economies) <br>
				SSP5: high challenges for mitigation (resource / fossil fuel intensive) and low for adapt. (rapid development)<br>
