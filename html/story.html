	The Shared Socio-Economic Pathway (SSPs) are Climate change projections and socio‚Äêeconomic scenarios used to evaluate climate impacts and adaptation measures.
	They are stablished by the climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation (Mitigation is a more development-friendly alternative to strict environmental laws because it allows development to occur where environmental laws might prohibit it.).

	The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development, and middle-of-the-road development.

	Overview : 

	SSP1: low challenges for mitigation (resource efficiency) and adaptation (rapid development)
	SSP3: high challenges for mitigation (regionalized energy / land policies) and adaptation (slow development) 
	SSP4: low challenges for mitigation (global high tech economy), high for adapt. (regional low tech economies) 
	SSP5: high challenges for mitigation (resource / fossil fuel intensive) and low for adapt. (rapid development)
